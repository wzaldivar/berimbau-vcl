I had abandoned this project years ago when stop working on Delphi 
and move to C++, Python and Java worlds. I wanted during years 
to depurate the code of WZ70 VCL my own code base and transform it 
to Berimbau VCL but isn´t in my plans, I don´t know if it will 
be again in my plans sometime in the future and Delphi 7 is so old now. 
So I'm adding WZ70 into files of the project for someone who need it 
or has the time to depurate this code. 
Isn´t my best work but it was so helpfull to me.

1. Delphi versions 

D7* 

* I'm just working with D7, I can't say if my actual work is 100% 
compatible with other versions, help to add support for other Delphi 
versions (or C++ Builder) are welcome. 

2. Waht's the meaning of Berimbau? 

The berimbau is a single-string percussion instrument, a musical bow, 
from Brazil. The berimbau's origins are not entirely clear, but there is 
not much doubt on its African origin, as no Indigenous Brazilian or 
European people use musical bows, and very similar instruments are 
played in the southern parts of Africa. The berimbau was eventually 
incorporated into the practice of the Afro-Brazilian martial art 
capoeira, where it commands how the capoeiristas move in the roda.

3. Why Beimbau? 

The berimbau is simple but with a powerfull sound. The idea behind 
Berimbau VCL is to get simple components with powerfull options for 
developers.
