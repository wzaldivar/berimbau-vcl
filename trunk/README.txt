1. Delphi versions 

D7* 

* I'm just working with D7, I can't say if my actual work is 100%

versions (or C++ Builder) are welcome. 

2. Watht's the meaning of Berimbau? 

The berimbau is a single-string percussion instrument, a musical bow, 
from Brazil. The berimbau's origins are not entirely clear, but there is 
not much doubt on its African origin, as no Indigenous Brazilian or 
European people use musical bows, and very similar instruments are 
played in the southern parts of Africa. The berimbau was eventually 
incorporated into the practice of the Afro-Brazilian martial art 
capoeira, where it commands how the capoeiristas move in the roda.

3. Why Beimbau? 

The berimbau is simple but with a powerfull sound. The idea behind 
BerimbauVCL is to get simple components with powerfull options for 
developers.
